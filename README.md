# YCgCr Leaf Segmentation
This is part of the project for the 2020.2 Deep Learning class at Universidade Federal de Alagoas.

The objective is to try to replicate and possibly improve the original paper by using Deep Learning techniques learned throughout the semester.

Student: Eduardo Antônio de Lucena Lisboa

### Dataset
The dataset used was the BRACOL dataset, a public domain Brazilian Arabica Coffee leaves dataset, which can be found [here][BRACOL_dataset].

To simplify, the version ready to be used with the training of the model can be found [here][drive_dataset].
